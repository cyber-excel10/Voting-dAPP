# 🌍 GlobalVote DApp – Build a Decentralized Voting Platform with Me!

Welcome to **GlobalVote**, a decentralized voting platform on Solana that lets anyone host secure, anonymous elections on any topic (e.g., local issues, global polls, or fun surveys). I’m building this solo for now, but I need *you*—coders, designers, translators, or anyone passionate about fair voting—to join the mission!
GlobalVote aims to make voting accessible, private, and trustworthy using:
- **Solana** for fast, scalable transactions.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** and **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** for anonymous, eligibility-based voting.
- **Rust** for secure smart contracts and backend.
- Features like multilingual UI, real-time results, gamification, and offline QR-based voting.

I’m a solo developer building this but I can’t do it alone. Whether you’re 15 or 75, a beginner or a pro, your skills can make a difference:
- **Impact**: Shape a platform for global civic engagement.
- **Learn**: Gain hands-on experience with Rust, Solana, ZKPs, and web3.
## 🛠️ How to Contribute
No matter your experience, there’s a way to help. I’ve broken it down into levels:

### 🌱 Beginner (No/Low Coding)
- **Tasks**: Test UI prototypes (coming soon), suggest poll ideas, translate text (e.g., Spanish, Yoruba), or share on X.
- **Tools**: Just a browser or GitHub account.
  
### 🛠️ Intermediate (Some Coding/Design)
- **Tasks**: Build UI components (React, Tailwind CSS), design badges (Figma), or test Solana smart contracts (Rust).
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, basic React/Rust knowledge (I’ll share tutorials).
- **Example**: Create a poll creation form or mockup a calendar view.

### 🚀 Advanced (Experienced Devs)
- **Tasks**: Write Solana smart contracts (Rust/Anchor), implement ZKPs (Circom/Veramo), or build WebSocket APIs (Node.js).
- **Tools**: Rust, Solana CLI, Circom, Node.js, Docker.
- **Example**: Code a ZKP circuit for voter eligibility

## 📋 Project Status
- **Current Stage**: Planning and prototyping (I’m setting up Rust smart contracts and React frontend).
- **Next Steps**: Build core voting logic, integrate ZKPs, and create a PWA.
- **Known Gaps**: 
  - Are ZKPs too complex for small polls?
  - How to secure offline QR voting?
  - Which features (e.g., mobile app vs. proxy voting) to prioritize?
- **Your Input**: Suggest fixes or new ideas via [Issues]().

## 🔧 Getting Started
1. **Star/Fork this Repo**: Stay updated or clone to contribute.
2. **Learn**: Use resources like [Solana Docs](https://docs.solana.com) or [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).
3. **Submit**: Create a pull request with your work.

## 📢 Call to Action
I’m building GlobalVote to make voting fair and fun, but I need your help. If you see flaws in the plan, have better ideas, or want to contribute, jump in! File an issue, tweet about it, or fork the repo. Let’s build something amazing together.

*Happy building!*
